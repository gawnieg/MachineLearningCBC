classregtree constructs unpruned classification tree with two branches
from each node , test function checks how <good> the tree is using two
methods,  resubstituation and cross validation.

Then prune tree with each test method 


-red line is resubstitution- tree is trained and tested on the same
 data (if not pruned (at 200 nodes), is perfect because testing and
 training data is exactly the same - overfitted though!!). will always
 get worse as pruned more.

-blue line is 10-fold cross-validation - explains why cost is higher -
 trained and tested on different data. will have optimum tree size.
